# Various CG Graphics Projects

This is a collection of various projects regarding 3D visualizing of a model.
It uses many OpenGL libraries and features.
Be sure to check the README.md of the libs folder to install all the required dependancies.

## PACMAN

The PACMAN project is by far the most complete of these, as it allows you to play a simplified version of pacman in 3D. I made the mazes smaller so you can see beyond the walls, because other 3D pacman games are extreamly annoying to play and I decided to not do it that way. You can also add your own mazes by changing Laberynths.cpp

## Waves

This bends the plane in a way to replicate a sine pattern, like very basic waves.
This is done through the usage of shaders, of course.

## Heights / Normals

Different shader tests for Height maps and Normal maps. The shading is a bit wonky in these, so it might be difficult to see the effects of the maps being applied.

## Textures

Simple shader to paint a texture onto an object.

## Cube / Plane / Triangle

Different steps towards creating a Triangle, a plane and finally a cube.
